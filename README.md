# Time Series Forecasting and Analysis
This repository contains Python code for performing time series forecasting and analysis using the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing method. The code is designed to work with time series data and provides insights into the data's seasonality, trends, and autocorrelation patterns.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* numpy: For numerical operations.
* matplotlib: For data visualization.
* statsmodels: For time series analysis and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing.
* scikit-learn: For performance metrics.
* Python 3.x

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the provided code files.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
3. Prepare your time series data in a CSV file named "train.csv" or modify the code to load your own dataset. The dataset should contain at least two columns: "Order Date" and "Sales."
4. Run the code to perform exploratory data analysis, time series forecasting, and cross-validation.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
The code begins by loading the time series data from the "train.csv" file. It then preprocesses the data, converting the "Order Date" column to a datetime format and sorting the data by date.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section of the code visualizes the time series data to understand its characteristics. It includes:
1. Plotting the sales data over time.
2. Calculating and visualizing rolling statistics for seasonality and trends.
3. Generating autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to understand temporal dependencies.

## Time Series Forecasting
The code uses the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing method to forecast sales for the next 7 days. It fits the model to the historical data, including trend and seasonality components, and generates forecasts.

## Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is performed using the TimeSeriesSplit technique to assess the model's performance. The code splits the data into training and validation sets and calculates Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each fold. It reports the mean and standard deviation of these performance metrics.
